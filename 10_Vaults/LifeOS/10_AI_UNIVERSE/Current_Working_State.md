# Current Working State

## Active Milestone

Foundation Lock-In for LifeOS V3 under `/home/lifeos`.

## Current Environment

- User: `lifeos`
- Root: `/home/lifeos`
- Vault: `/home/lifeos/10_Vaults/LifeOS`
- Event log: `/home/lifeos/50_Event_Log/events.jsonl`
- OpenCode config: `/home/lifeos/.config/opencode/opencode.json`
- OpenCode binary: `/home/lifeos/.local/bin/opencode`

## Completed

- LifeOS V3 source-of-truth plan created.
- Phase 1 scaffold created.
- Phase 1B decisions encoded.
- New `lifeos` user created.
- Login password repaired.
- Scaffold copied into `/home/lifeos`.
- Event log contains scaffold, decision, and login repair events.
- OpenCode handoff/config package prepared for `lifeos`.
- OpenCode verified running as `lifeos` from `/home/lifeos`.
- Groups verified: `docker`, `video`, `render`.
- Git, Docker CLI, Node/npm, and OpenCode availability verified.
- Git initialized safely for `/home/lifeos`.
- Safe `.gitignore` added for secrets, service data, backups, raw imports, migration work, local state, and copied reference/vendor trees.
- Initial clean scaffold/control-plane commit created: `85acdb7 Initialize LifeOS V3 scaffold`.
- Git branch renamed to `main`.
- Local bare Git backup remote created at `/home/lifeos/70_Backups/git/lifeos.git` and `main` pushed.
- Obsidian Flatpak removed and official AppImage downloaded to ignored local path `/home/lifeos/Applications/Obsidian-1.12.7.AppImage`.
- Agency Agents reference updated from `https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents.git` to commit `6f8d5e5`.
- Curated Agency OpenCode subagents installed under `/home/lifeos/.config/opencode/agents/`.
- Off-machine Git backup explicitly deferred by user approval so inert service scaffolding may proceed.
- Inert n8n compose/config scaffold created without starting services, pulling images, or configuring real secrets.
- Dedicated SSH key created locally for off-machine Git backup; private key remains under ignored `/home/lifeos/.ssh/`.
- Off-machine Git remote `offsite` configured for GitHub repo `brileyscott-rgb/lifeos-v3` and `main` pushed.

## Current Decisions

- ChatOps: Telegram
- Alerts later: Gotify or ntfy
- Vault sync: Git first
- Capture sync later: Syncthing if needed
- AI strategy: hybrid local plus cloud
- Vector store: Qdrant
- Structured state: SQLite first
- A3 agents: Project Maintainer and Semantic Janitor only
- Migration deletion: manual A4 approval every time, quarantine first
- Backup strategy: Git plus restic later
- Service order: Git, n8n, Telegram, Paperless-ngx, Qdrant, monitoring, MCP

## Active Deferrals

- None active. The earlier off-machine Git backup deferral was superseded by GitHub remote setup at `2026-07-06T02:11:21Z`.

## Next Milestone

Foundation Lock-In:

1. Verify GitHub off-machine remote during routine backup checks.
2. Open Obsidian vault at `/home/lifeos/10_Vaults/LifeOS` from the desktop AppImage launcher; terminal launch reaches the callback but fails GPU initialization in this session.
3. Restart OpenCode so the new Agency subagents are loaded.
4. Review n8n compose/config scaffold before any service activation.

## Do Not Do Yet

- Do not migrate old LifeOS files yet.
- Do not start Docker services yet.
- Do not configure real Telegram/n8n/Paperless/Qdrant secrets yet.
- Do not loosen `/home/lifeos/40_Services/secrets` permissions.
- Do not treat the local bare Git remote as a substitute for off-machine backup.
- Do not install the full Agency roster into OpenCode unless the OpenCode agent registration limit is resolved or the selection remains below the known limit.
